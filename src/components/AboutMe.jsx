              Hello! I'm Jahid Hasan Rifat, a passionate and dedicated Frontend Developer. My journey with programming started in my collage days when I first got introduced to HTML and CSS. From then, I became fascinated by the idea of creating beautiful, user-friendly websites and web applications. Over time, my passion grew, and I started diving into JavaScript and React.js to build dynamic and interactive web experiences.

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-600 mb-6">
              As a developer, I enjoy the process of solving problems and continuously learning new skills. I love working on projects that challenge me and help me grow. When Iâ€™m not coding, I enjoy collaborating with other developers and sharing knowledge through blogs and community discussions.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg text-gray-600">
              Outside of programming, I have a variety of interests that keep me balanced. I enjoy playing sports, particularly football and cricket. It's a great way for me to relax and stay active. I also have a creative side, and I enjoy cooking and gardening whenever I get the chance. Whether it's a quick doodle or a more detailed piece, it helps me express my thoughts and unwind.
